"""
Given an array A[] consisting of N elements, the task is to find the minimum distance between the minimum and the
maximum element of the array.
Input: arr[] = {3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, 8, 2}
Output: 3
Explanation:
The minimum element(= 1) is present at indices {2, 4}
The maximum element(= 8) is present at indices {7, 10}.
The minimum distance between an occurrence of 1 and 8 is 7 â€“ 4 = 3
